## Description

This is a plugin that lets you add dividers to your code using comments. Diver types include lines and boxes. Sample can be found [here](examples.txt).

pressing `Ctrl + Shift + A` and
typing `Code Divider`. This will bring up a list of all available dividers. Selecting one will insert it at the current
cursor position. Alternatively, selecting `Code Divider` will bring up a menu of all available dividers.

## Settings
